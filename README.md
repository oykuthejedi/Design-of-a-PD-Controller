Design a PD controller for the plant function given below to reduce the settling time by a
factor of 4 while continuing to operate the system with 20.5% overshoot. Assume unity
feedback of the system. Compare the performance of the compensated system to that
of the uncompensated system. Provide root locus plots, pzmap, and comparative step
and ramp input responses. Summarize the results in a table similar to examples done in
class.  𝐺(𝑠) = K / (𝑠(𝑠 + 10)(𝑠 + 20))
